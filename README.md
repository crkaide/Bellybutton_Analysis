# Bellybutton Analysis

## Notes

### Folder Structure

_The correct folder structure, as stated by the module, is an index.html file on the same level as three add'l folders: css, images, and js.  The structure of this repo *breaks* these conventions by necessity.  The js files will only correctly connect to the src links when *all files* (that is, js, json, and html) occupy the same level._

_Initial troubleshooting included correctly filing the js scripts (into the js folder) and attempting to link to them via both 1) relative file name, and then 2) the direct file path.  As long as html and js files are not housed in the same folder, this does not seem to wish to run correctly._
